# aguafina-app
Aguafina App is a web application used by customers and employees of a fictional mineral water company, Aguafina. The user roles are admin, employee, and customer.
An employee has access to view all available orders, view and update all customers, view their own completed orders, and create new orders. 
The administrator has the same privileges, as well as delete orders and view all employees. A customer can only view their order history and update their 
personal information.
